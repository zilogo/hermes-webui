## Sprint 7: Wave 2 Core -- Cron/Skill/Memory CRUD + Session Content Search (COMPLETED)

**Theme:** "Wave 2 Core -- Cron/Skill/Memory CRUD + Session Content Search"

### Track A: Bug Fixes
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Activity bar sizing | Activity bar sometimes overlaps first message on short viewports |
| Model dropdown sync | Model chip in topbar sometimes shows stale model after session switch |
| Cron output truncation | Long cron output in the tasks panel overflows its container |

### Track B: Features
| Feature | What | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| Session content search | Search message text across all sessions, not just titles. GET /api/sessions/search already does title search; extend to message content with a configurable depth limit | High: the single most-requested nav feature after rename |
| Cron edit + delete | Edit an existing cron job (name, schedule, prompt, delivery) inline in the tasks panel. Delete with confirm. POST /api/crons/update and /api/crons/delete | High: closes the cron CRUD gap (create was Sprint 6) |
| Skill create + edit | A "New skill" form in the Skills panel. Name, category, SKILL.md content in a textarea editor. Save calls POST /api/skills/save (writes to ~/.hermes/skills/). Edit opens existing skill in the same editor | High: biggest remaining CLI gap after cron |

### Track C: Architecture
| Item | What |
|------|------|
| Phase E: app.js module split (start) | Split app.js (1332 lines) into logical modules: sessions.js, chat.js, workspace.js, panels.js, ui.js. Serve via ES module imports in index.html. This is Phase E completion. |
| Health endpoint improvement | Add active_streams, uptime_seconds to /health response (Phase G) |
| Git init | git init <repo>, first commit, push to private GitHub repo |

### Tests
- ~20 new pytest tests (cron update/delete, skill save, session content search)
- TESTING.md: Sections 29-31 (cron edit, skill edit, session search)
- Estimated total after Sprint 7: ~126
