# Hermes Web UI: Browser Testing Plan

> This document is for manual browser testing by you or by a Claude browser agent.
> It covers user-facing features of the UI through Sprint 19 (v0.21).
> Each section is written as a step-by-step test procedure with expected outcomes.
> A browser agent (e.g. Claude with Chrome access) can execute this plan directly.
>
> Prerequisites: SSH tunnel is active on port 8787. Open http://localhost:8787 in browser.
> Server health check: curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health should return {"status":"ok"}.
>
> Automated tests: 328 total (328 passing, 0 failures).
> Run: `pytest tests/ -v --timeout=60`

## Automated Test Coverage Reference

These behaviors are verified by pytest (run: venv/bin/python -m pytest webui-mvp/tests/ -v):

Sprint 1 tests (test_sprint1.py):
  - Server health, session CRUD (create/load/update/delete/sort)
  - B11 footgun fix (/api/session 400 on missing ID)
  - Multipart parser: text file, binary PNG
  - HTTP upload: success, too large, no file field, bad session
  - Approval API: pending, inject+deny, inject+session-approve
  - Stream status endpoint
  - File listing, path traversal block

Sprint 2 tests (test_sprint2.py):
  - GET /api/file/raw: PNG, JPEG, SVG content-types
  - GET /api/file/raw: path traversal blocked, missing file 404
  - GET /api/file: markdown content returned as text
  - GET /api/file: markdown with table content preserved
  - GET /api/list: image and markdown files appear in directory listing

Manual-only tests (not covered by automation):
  - All browser rendering tests (T5.5, T5.6, T5.7 -- visual verification)
  - T7.1-T7.3 -- tool approval card (requires live agent execution)
  - T9.1 -- reconnect banner timing
  - T10.1 -- concurrent session switching
  - T11.1, T11.2 -- responsive layout
  - T11.3 -- log output verification
  - All visual/CSS checks

## Claude Browser Agent Instructions

If you are a Claude agent with browser access, follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8787 (assumes SSH tunnel is active from your Mac).
2. Execute tests in order. For each test:
   a. Follow SETUP instructions.
   b. Perform each STEP using browser tools (click, type, navigate).
   c. Use browser_vision or browser_snapshot to verify EXPECT conditions.
   d. Record PASS or FAIL with a brief note on what you observed.
3. For tests requiring file uploads: use the browser's file picker; you may need to
   create test files in /tmp first via terminal.
4. For T7.x (approval tests): the agent running inside Hermes needs to detect a
   dangerous command. Ask Hermes to "run: rm -rf /tmp/test_hermes_approval" and watch
   for the card. The actual rm will not run in a safe test workspace.
5. Skip T9.1 (reconnect banner) unless you can precisely time a page reload during an
   active SSE stream.
6. Report results as a checklist at the end.

## Sections Added Post-Sprint 10 (Sprints 11-19)

The following features were added in Sprints 11-19 and need manual browser testing.
Each has automated API-level tests in `tests/test_sprint{N}.py`.

### Sprint 11: Multi-Provider Models
- Open model dropdown. Verify models grouped by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- If custom `base_url` configured in config.yaml, verify local models appear in dropdown.
- Switch model. Send a message. Verify response uses selected model.

### Sprint 12: Settings + Pin + Import
- Click gear icon. Settings overlay opens.
- Change default model, save. Restart server. Verify setting persisted.
- Pin a session (star icon in hover overlay). Verify it floats to top of list.
- Export session as JSON. Import it back. Verify messages restored.

### Sprint 13: Alerts + Session QoL
- Duplicate a session (copy icon in hover overlay). Verify "(copy)" title.
- Browser tab title updates to active session name. Switch sessions — title changes.

### Sprint 14: Visual Polish + Workspace Ops
- Create a mermaid code block in a response. Verify diagram renders inline.
- Message timestamps visible next to role labels (hover for full date).
- Double-click a file in workspace panel to rename. Enter saves, Escape cancels.
- Create a folder via folder icon in workspace header.
- Add `#tag` to session title. Verify tag chip appears in sidebar. Click to filter.
- Archive a session. Verify it disappears. Toggle "Show archived" to see it.

### Sprint 15: Session Projects
- Click "+" in project bar to create a project. Type name, Enter.
- Click a project chip to filter sessions.
- Hover a session → click folder icon → assign to project via picker.
- Verify colored left border appears on assigned session.
- Double-click project chip to rename. Right-click to delete.
- Code blocks have a "Copy" button. Click → "Copied!" feedback.
- Messages with 2+ tool cards show "Expand all / Collapse all" toggle.

### Sprint 16: Sidebar Visual Polish
- Session titles use full sidebar width (no truncated space for hidden icons).
- Hover a session → action buttons appear from right with gradient fade.
- All icons are monochrome SVGs (not emoji). Consistent across platforms.
- Pinned sessions show small gold star inline. Unpinned = no star, full title width.
- Active session has gold highlight (not blue). Overlay gradient matches.
- Double-click to rename → overlay hides during rename.

### Sprint 17: Workspace + Slash Commands + Send Key
- Navigate into a subdirectory. Breadcrumb bar appears with clickable segments.
- Up button in panel header navigates to parent. Hidden at root.
- Type `/` in composer → autocomplete dropdown appears. Arrow keys navigate.
- Type `/help` → lists all commands. `/clear` clears conversation. `/model` switches.
- Settings panel: change send key to Ctrl+Enter. Verify Enter inserts newline.

### Sprint 18: Thinking + Tree View + Preview Fix
- View a file in workspace. Click a breadcrumb or folder → preview closes automatically.
- Click a directory toggle arrow (▸) → expands in-place showing children.
- Click again (▾) → collapses. Double-click navigates into it (breadcrumb view).
- If model returns thinking blocks (Claude extended thinking), verify collapsible gold card appears above response.

### Sprint 19: Auth + Security
- No password set: everything works as normal. No login page.
- Set `HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD=test` env var. Restart. All pages redirect to `/login`.
- Login page: minimal card, password field, "Sign in" button.
- Enter correct password → redirected to `/`. Cookie set (24h).
- Enter wrong password → error message, stay on login page.
- Settings panel: set password via "Access Password" field. Auth activates.
- "Sign Out" button visible when auth active. Click → redirected to /login.
- API calls without auth cookie → 401 JSON response.
- Check response headers: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.
